# Jobscraper
First Python/webscraping project, intended as a familiarization/learning project. Uses Beautiful Soup 4 library.
Scrapes provided seed url (indeed job board), writes information about job postings to generated CSV file.
Searches for further pages on seed page to scrape, recursively scrapes postings on new pages and adds to CSV.
Makes searching for jobs easier, as it provides summary of postings in easy to read local CSV file.
