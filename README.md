# Jobscraper
First Python/webscraping project, intended as a familiarization/practical use project. Uses Beautiful Soup 4 library.
Scrapes provided seed urls (indeed and glassdoor job boards), writes information about job postings to generated CSV files.
Searches for further pages on seed pages to scrape, recursively scrapes postings on new pages and adds to CSVs.
Makes searching for jobs easier, as it provides summary of postings in easy to read local CSV file.
